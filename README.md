# Humming-Bird
![Zef Badge](https://raku.land/zef:rawleyfowler/Humming-Bird/badges/version)

Humming-Bird is a simple, composable, and performant, all in one HTTP web-framework for Raku.
Humming-Bird was inspired mainly by [Opium](https://github.com/rgrinberg/opium), [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com), and [Express](https://expressjs.com), and tries to keep
things relatively simple, allowing the user to pull in things like templating engines,
and ORM's on their own terms.

Humming-Bird comes with what you need to quickly, and efficiently spin up REST API's, and with a few small plugins, dynamic MVC style web-apps.

## Examples

#### Simple example:
```raku
use v6;

use Humming-Bird::Core;

get('/', -> $request, $response {
    $response.html('<h1>Hello World</h1>');
});

listen(8080);

# Navigate to localhost:8080!
```

#### Simple JSON example:
```raku
use v6;

use Humming-Bird::Core;

my %users = Map.new('bob', '{ "name": "bob" }', 'joe', '{ "name": "joe" }');

get('/users/:user', -> $request, $response {
    my $user = $request.param('user');

    if %users{$user}:exists {
        $response.json(%users{$user});
    } else {
        $response.status(404);
    }
});

listen(8080);
```

#### Middleware
```raku
use v6;

use Humming-Bird::Core;
use Humming-Bird::Middleware;

get('/logged', -> $request, $response {
    $response.html('This request has been logged!');
}, [ &m_logger ]); # &m_logger is provided by Humming-Bird::Middleware

# Custom middleware
sub block-firefox($request, $response, &next) {
    return $response.status(400) if $request.header('User-Agent').starts-with('Mozilla');
    $response.status(200);
}

get('/no-firefox', -> $request, $response {
    $response.html('You are not using Firefox!');
}, [ &m_logger, &block-firefox ]);

# Scoped middleware

# Both of these routes will now share the middleware specified in the last parameter of the group.
group([
    &get.assuming('/', -> $request, $response {
        $response.write('Index');
    }),

    &post.assuming('/users', -> $request, $response {
        $response.write($request.body).status(204);
    })
], [ &m_logger, &block-firefox ]);
```

## Design
- Humming-Bird should be easy to pickup, and simple for developers new to Raku and/or web development.
- Humming-Bird is not designed to be exposed to the internet directly. You should hide Humming-Bird behind a reverse-proxy like NGiNX or httpd.
- Simple and composable via middlewares.

## Things to keep in mind
- This project is in active development, things will break.
- You may run into bugs.
- **Not** production ready, yet.
